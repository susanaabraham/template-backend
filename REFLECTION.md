What I think I did right during this process:
It was very helpful to be able to verify the reader before and during the practice assessment.
Also, after I come up with a plan and break it down into small steps, everything had more sense.
Once I had a better idea of how to start the practice assessment, it was all clearer to get started.
In this process what I think I did right is while I was going through the features I applied npm run start, to been able to see if I needed fix or verify that everything was working correctly.

Overall it was a good challenge and I am very proud of my progress. While I was going through the features, I was able to see what I learned and my progress with my application until I saw the big picture "a fully functional application".

What I would do differently next time to improve: 
I think that we can always improve with practice, especially when it comes to code.
I think that for me more than anything is the frustration when an error comes out and I get stuck, but I still thinking if I keep practicing I can solve those errors quickly.
