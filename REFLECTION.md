What I think I did right during this process:
It was very helpful to check the reader before and during the practice assessment.
Also, after I came up with a plan and broke it down into small steps, the plan was more useful and made more sense.
Once I had a better idea on how to start the practice assessment, it was easier to work on it.
In this process what I think I did right is while I was going through the features, I applied npm run start, it allowed me to check if everything was working correctly or if I needed to fix something.

Overall it was a good challenge and I am very proud of my progress. While I was going through the features I was able to see what I learned so far and the progress with my application. Be able to see the big picture: "a fully functional application" definitely makes me feel more confident!

What I would do differently next time to improve: 
I think that we can always improve with practice, especially when it comes to code.
I'm learning to deal with the frustration when an error comes out and I get stuck. Practice will allow me to solve those errors and even avoid them.
